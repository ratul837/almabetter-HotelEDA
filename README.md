Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking Dataset
Objective:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and booking patterns.
Dataset Details:

Type: Hotel reservations
Includes: Data from city hotels and resort hotels
Size: 32 columns and 119,390 rows
Information Contained:
Booking dates
Customer demographics
Reservation details
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Steps Taken:

Removing Missing Values:
Examined each column for null values.
Dropped columns with a high percentage of missing values (e.g., "company" column).
Handling Duplicates:
Identified and removed 31,994 duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Data Type Verification:
Checked and corrected inaccurate data types for various columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Process:

Identifying Distinct Values:
Created a list of distinct values for each column in a tabular format to enhance understanding of the data.
Data Visualization:
Employed various graphical techniques, including:
Histograms
Scatter plots
Heat maps
Discovered key insights, such as:
Most bookings were made between July and August.
Conclusion
Workflow Categories:

The data manipulation process can be divided into three main stages:
Data Collection
Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Insights:

Booking Trends: A significant number of bookings occur during the peak months of July and August.
Data Integrity: The cleaning process ensured the dataset was free from duplicates and inaccuracies, allowing for more reliable analysis.
Goal:

Utilize various charts for data visualization to achieve a deeper understanding of customer behavior and booking patterns, ultimately aligning findings with business strategies in the hospitality industry.
