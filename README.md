Project Overview : Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking Dataset.
The objective of this project was to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and booking patterns. The dataset includes information from various city and resort hotels, comprising 32 columns and 119,390 rows, detailing booking dates, customer demographics, and reservation specifics.

Following the data manipulation, we proceeded with the EDA. This included identifying distinct values for each column and visualizing the data using techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps. Notably, our analysis revealed that most bookings occurred between July and August.

The data cleaning and preprocessing phase involved several key steps. We first examined each column for missing values, removing those with a high percentage of null entries, such as the "company" column. We also identified and eliminated 31,994 duplicate records to ensure data integrity. Additionally, we verified and corrected any inaccuracies in data types across the dataset.

In summary, the workflow for this project can be categorized into three main stages: data collection, data cleaning and manipulation, and exploratory data analysis. 

The insights gained, particularly regarding booking trends and data integrity, provide valuable information that can inform business strategies in the hospitality industry.
